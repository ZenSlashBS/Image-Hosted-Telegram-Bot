In Action
When you send an image, the bot processes it using the Freeimage.host API and responds with a direct link. Inline buttons make it easy to view the image or discover other bots. Behind the scenes, the bot logs the upload to a backup channel, including the user‚Äôs ID, username (if available), and the image link. This ensures you can track uploads or contact users if needed.
Technical Details
The bot is built with Python using the python-telegram-bot library (version 20.0+ for async support). It uses the Freeimage.host API to upload images asynchronously, ensuring smooth performance even with large files. The bot handles errors gracefully, notifying users if an upload fails.
